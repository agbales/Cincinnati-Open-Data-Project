# Cincinnati Police Open Data

This project combines data from the [Cincinnati Open Data Portal](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/) to provide insights into Cincinnati police calls, responses, arrests, and complaints.

Right now, you'll find preliminary work with the [Citizen Complaints](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Safer-Streets/Citizen-Complaints/r3vg-n6p3) record. [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) is used visualize ratios of genders and races. This information is available for both complainants and officers. With this start, we can begin to compare data from various districts and even neighborhoods.

Moving forward, I plan to incorporate open data sets to provide a context for these distributions. For instance, knowing the overall number of police calls a particular district or neighborhood allows for a more accurate portrait of complaint ratios.
