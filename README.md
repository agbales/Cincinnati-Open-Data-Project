# Cincinnati Police Open Data

This project combines data from the [Cincinnati Open Data Portal](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/) to provide insights into Cincinnati police calls, responses, arrests, and complaints.

Right now, you'll find preliminary work with the [Citizen Copmplaints](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov/Safer-Streets/Citizen-Complaints/r3vg-n6p3) record. This data is visualized with [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) to compare ratios between cincinnati districts and neighborhoods. It will be important to incorporate other data sets to provide a context for these distributions.
